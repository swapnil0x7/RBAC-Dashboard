# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard

A dashboard application implementing role-based access control to display sections specific to user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) and allow role switching. This project demonstrates how to dynamically adjust user experiences based on their assigned roles, using React and state management techniques.

## Objective

To create a role-based access control (RBAC) dashboard where users are assigned roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) that determine which sections they can access. Users can dynamically switch roles, and the UI adjusts accordingly to display or hide content.
